--------------
Number of repeats : 1 
Injection time per protocol line : 31000 ms or 31.00 s
Estimated time to complete measurements : 14.47 min 
--------------
Stimulation Mode is ON! - Randomised phase delay triggered by phase marker on Keithley
250 uS pulse triggered every 500 ms with offset 2 ms from channel switch
Approx 61 stims per injection
