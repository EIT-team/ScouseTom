# 3D Printable cases for ScouseTom Boards
As the size of the boards are a bit odd, we 3D print the cases for both parts of the system. The solid models are included, but those who just want to print can use the `.stl` files:

### Switchboard cases
Print both with the flattest surface at the bottom
- `SwitchBoardCase - Lid`
- `SwitchBoardCase - Main`

### Arduino + Shield cases
To reduce the support material when printing with Makerbot Replicator 2 - use the settings shown in `ScouseTomShieldPrintSettings`

- `ScouseTomCasePrintLid`
- `ScouseTomCasePrintMain`
