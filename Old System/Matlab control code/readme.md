#Matlab control Code
This is the last version to be written - NOT the version kirill was using for his experiments NOR is it the hastily cobbled together version for two arduinos

## How to control it

### ScouseTom_Setup 
this gets the settings for the injection and writes them to the arduino and the current source

### ScouseTom_Zinject
performs the adjacent/nighbouring protocol for contact impedance checking

### ScouseTom_Startinject
starts the normal current injection
