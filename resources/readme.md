## data
Data collected on resistor phantoms, used for getting system specs for paper.

## protocols
Protocol files which can be used for creating the `ExpSetup` structure

## stim_calibration
Example outputs from stimulator calibration - potentiometer settings for given stimulator voltages. These are the ones used to create the default settings (no one calibrates it anyways...)
