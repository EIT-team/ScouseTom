Description of this ExpSetup file : resistor phantom load test
ExpSetup created : 31-Jul-2015 15:05:43
The EEG system file stored was : Null- user was testing
The PC name was : DESKTOP-S1F6OF9
The Username was : eit
--------------
System in "SingleFreqMode" - single amp and freq, running continuously
Amplitude: 10 uA
Frequency: 225 Hz
Protocol loaded was NCopt_markus_prot.txt with 1 lines 
Sources	Sinks
11	13
--------------
Number of repeats : 1 
Injection time per protocol line : 60000 ms or 60.00 s
Estimated time to complete measurements : 1.00 min 
--------------
Stimulation Mode is ON! - Randomised phase delay triggered by phase marker on Keithley
1000 uS pulse triggered every 1000 ms with offset 2 ms from channel switch
Approx 59 stims per injection
